                    <p>I was so happy and excited when I found out my baby was a boy. 
                        I always wanted a boy first and I knew Devin also wanted a boy.</p>

                        Staying in the hospital for a week after was very hard and I was so ready to get out of there and bring Asher home!</p>

                    <p>Asher is now 19 months, walking, talking and getting into everything! Asher loves being outside, he loves being rocked, and he loves peanut butter! 
                        I am so proud of him every day for how much he's growing and learning and I can't wait to see what happens next! 
                        I don't know where I would be without him, he has definitely changed my life for better and I couldn't imagine my life without him.</p>
